ADDONS 0.5:

- "fly" command 2 movepoints worth if the player is allowed to fly costs might
  rise to 3 or 4 in future releases
- drop ban on "repeat, until, .." because that has no value but harming Lua as
  a language. You can do loops with goto and recursive function calls you can
  add strings togehter with other means. ".." isn't nice, but it's still not a
  problem. And I really like repeat..until. The alternative is goto.
- (nyi) more digging costs but just "stone" (not yet implemented)
- (nyi) lift ban on "coroutine" for everyone, they are no harm but strength of Lua
- (nyi) turtle routine that draws "turtle-strings", using building material
- (nyi) Bresnham line and circle (arc) as coroutines
- (nyi) fill 
- (nyi) path finding

and many more to comeâ€¦ now let's code!

GAMEPLAY:

- robot has limited operations available every run ( 1 run per 1 second).
- while using for loops, while loops or function calls it is limited to default 48 such code executions per run
- while using 'physical' operations like move/dig robot has (default) 10 operations available per run. Default costs are
  move=2, fly=2, dig = 6, insert = 2, place = 2, machine.generate = 6, machine.smelt = 6, machine.grind = 6,
